# ðŸš€ Design System ðŸš€

This project is a design system aimed at creating and providing a token package, along with visual components that will be used in other applications, as well as the documentation for both.

These packages were made available on NPM and the project was organized using the structure of a monorepo.

### NPM:
You can install these packages separately
```bash
  # React components
  npm i @degui-ui/react

  # Design system - tokens
  npm i @degui-ui/tokens
```
